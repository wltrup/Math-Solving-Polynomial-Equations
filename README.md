# Solving Polynomial Equations

[Evarist Galois](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ã‰variste_Galois) has long proved that no polynomial equation of degree 5 or above can be solved in closed analytical form. Solving a quadratic equation, on the other hand, is trivial. How about polynomial equations of degrees 3 and 4? Here you will find the complete analytical solution for general polynomial equations of both degrees. Originally written on August 28, 2006.
